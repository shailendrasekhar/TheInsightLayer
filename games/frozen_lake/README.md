        self.algorithm_name = "Double-Q-Learning"
        # Initialize second Q-table for Double Q-Learning
        self.q_table2 = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))
    
    def update_q_value(self, state, action, reward, next_state, next_action=None, done=False):

### Technical Training Details

#### Hyperparameter Impact
```python
# Standard configuration used in training
learning_rate = 0.1        # How much to update Q-values each step
discount_factor = 0.95     # Future reward importance (γ)
epsilon = 1.0              # Initial exploration rate
epsilon_decay = 0.995      # Exploration reduction per episode  
min_epsilon = 0.01         # Minimum exploration rate
```

#### Key Metrics Explained

**Success Rate**: Percentage of episodes where agent reaches goal (G)
- Formula: `successes / total_episodes * 100`
- Target: >60% for 4x4 slippery, >90% for 4x4 deterministic

**Average Reward**: Mean reward per episode
- 1.0 = reached goal, 0.0 = fell in hole
- Directly correlates with success rate

**Average Steps**: Efficiency metric
- Lower is better (faster goal reaching)
- Optimal path is 6 steps for 4x4 grid
- High steps indicate inefficient exploration

**Epsilon Values**: Exploration vs exploitation balance
- Starts at 1.0 (100% random exploration)
- Decays to 0.01 (1% exploration, 99% exploitation)
- Critical for learning progression

#### Training Performance Patterns

1. **Early Training (Episodes 1-200)**:
   - High exploration, low success rate
   - Epsilon > 0.8, success rate < 20%

2. **Mid Training (Episodes 200-600)**:
   - Balanced exploration/exploitation  
   - Epsilon 0.3-0.8, success rate 20-50%
   - Policy begins to emerge

3. **Late Training (Episodes 600-1000)**:
   - Mostly exploitation, refined policy
   - Epsilon < 0.3, success rate 50-80%
   - Fine-tuning of Q-values

## Algorithm Technical Deep Dive

Understanding how each algorithm works is crucial for selecting the right approach. Below are detailed explanations of each algorithm's mechanisms and key differences.

### Core Learning Mechanisms

#### **Q-Learning (Off-Policy TD Learning)**
```python
# Update rule: Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```
**How it works:**
- Learns the optimal action-value function Q*(s,a) regardless of the policy being followed
- Uses the maximum Q-value of the next state for updates (greedy with respect to Q-table)
- Can learn from any experience, even from other policies (off-policy)

**Key Mechanism:** Bootstrapping with maximum future value
**Main Advantage:** Can learn optimal policy even while following suboptimal policy
**Main Disadvantage:** Can suffer from overestimation bias

---

#### **SARSA (On-Policy TD Learning)**
```python
# Update rule: Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α[r + γ Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```
**How it works:**
- Learns the value of the policy it's actually following
- Uses the Q-value of the action actually taken in the next state
- More conservative because it considers the exploration policy

**Key Mechanism:** Bootstrapping with actual next action
**Main Advantage:** Learns the true value of the policy being followed, safer
**Main Disadvantage:** Can only learn about the policy it's currently following

---

#### **Expected SARSA (Hybrid Approach)**
```python
# Update rule: Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α[r + γ Σ π(a'|s') Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```
**How it works:**
- Uses expected value over all possible next actions weighted by policy
- Combines aspects of Q-Learning and SARSA
- More stable than SARSA, more conservative than Q-Learning

**Key Mechanism:** Expected value calculation over action probabilities
**Main Advantage:** Reduced variance compared to SARSA
**Main Disadvantage:** Computationally more expensive

### Advanced Exploration Methods

#### **Double Q-Learning (Bias Reduction)**
```python
# Maintains two Q-tables: Q1 and Q2
# Randomly choose which to update, use other for target calculation
```
**How it works:**
- Maintains two separate Q-tables to reduce overestimation bias
- Randomly selects which Q-table to update each step
- Uses one Q-table to select action, other to evaluate it (decoupling)

**Key Innovation:** Separates action selection from action evaluation
**Main Advantage:** Significantly reduces overestimation bias of Q-Learning
**Main Disadvantage:** Doubles memory requirements and computational cost

---

#### **UCB Q-Learning (Confidence-Based Exploration)**
```python
# Action selection: argmax[Q(s,a) + c√(ln(t)/N(s,a))]
```
**How it works:**
- Uses Upper Confidence Bound for action selection instead of epsilon-greedy
- Automatically balances exploration and exploitation based on uncertainty
- Prioritizes actions with high Q-values OR high uncertainty

**Key Innovation:** Principled exploration based on confidence intervals
**Main Advantage:** More systematic exploration, automatically reduces exploration over time
**Main Disadvantage:** Requires tracking action counts, can be conservative

---

#### **Boltzmann Q-Learning (Temperature-Based Selection)**
```python
# Action probabilities: P(a|s) = exp(Q(s,a)/T) / Σ exp(Q(s,a')/T)
```
**How it works:**
- Uses softmax (Boltzmann) distribution for action selection
- Temperature parameter controls exploration: high T = more random, low T = more greedy
- Naturally transitions from exploration to exploitation as temperature decays

**Key Innovation:** Smooth probabilistic action selection based on Q-values
**Main Advantage:** Gradual transition from exploration to exploitation, considers all actions
**Main Disadvantage:** Requires temperature scheduling, sensitive to Q-value scales

### Enhanced Learning Methods

#### **N-Step Q-Learning (Multi-Step Bootstrap)**
```python
# Uses n-step return: R(t) + γR(t+1) + ... + γ^n Q(s(t+n), a(t+n))
```
**How it works:**
- Accumulates rewards over n steps before updating
- Bridges gap between TD learning (1-step) and Monte Carlo (full episode)
- Provides faster credit assignment for delayed rewards

**Key Innovation:** Multi-step returns for better credit assignment
**Main Advantage:** Faster learning with delayed rewards, less bias than TD
**Main Disadvantage:** Higher variance, requires storing trajectories

---

#### **Monte Carlo Control (Episodic Learning)**
```python
# Uses complete episode returns: Q(s,a) = average of all returns from (s,a)
```
**How it works:**
- Waits for complete episodes to finish before updating
- Uses actual returns (not bootstrapped estimates)
- Updates Q-values as running averages of observed returns

**Key Innovation:** No bootstrapping, uses actual episode outcomes
**Main Advantage:** Unbiased value estimates, model-free
**Main Disadvantage:** High variance, slow learning, requires episodic tasks

---

#### **Dyna-Q (Model-Based Planning)**
```python
# Direct learning: Q-update from real experience
# Indirect learning: Q-updates from simulated experience using learned model
```
**How it works:**
- Learns environment model while learning Q-values
- Performs additional "planning" updates using simulated experience
- Combines model-free learning with model-based planning

**Key Innovation:** Learning and planning in a unified framework
**Main Advantage:** Sample efficiency through simulated experience
**Main Disadvantage:** Model learning overhead, assumes deterministic model

### Experience Replay Methods

#### **Experience Replay Q-Learning (Sample Efficiency)**
```python
# Store experiences: (s, a, r, s', done)
# Sample random batches for Q-updates
```
**How it works:**
- Stores experiences in a replay buffer
- Periodically samples random batches for Q-learning updates
- Breaks temporal correlation in experience sequence

**Key Innovation:** Reusing past experiences multiple times
**Main Advantage:** Better sample efficiency, breaks correlation, stabilizes learning
**Main Disadvantage:** Memory overhead, computational cost of replay

---

#### **Prioritized Experience Replay (Importance-Based Sampling)**
```python
# Priority based on TD-error: |r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)|
# Sample with probability proportional to priority
```
**How it works:**
- Assigns priorities to experiences based on TD-error magnitude
- Samples experiences with probability proportional to priority
- Uses importance sampling weights to correct for bias

**Key Innovation:** Intelligent experience selection based on learning potential
**Main Advantage:** Focuses on important transitions, faster learning
**Main Disadvantage:** Complex implementation, additional hyperparameters
